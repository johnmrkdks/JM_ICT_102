        //What happens when you compare two Strings with the == operator in java
       // In Java, when you use the == operator to compare two strings, you are comparing the references to the string objects, not the actual contents of the strings. This means that == checks whether the two string references point to the same memory location, rather than whether the strings have the same characters.
